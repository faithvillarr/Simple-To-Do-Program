# A Simple To-Do List Maker #
The website is pretty simple. The user can create tasks, mark tasks finished and delete tasks. I made this website in about 4 hours just to learn some Javascript basics. 
As someone who can't work without music, I also added a little music button with one of my favorite songs to relax to: 'Solitude', sung by Billie Holiday.
